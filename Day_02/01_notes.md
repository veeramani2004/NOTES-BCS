'd be happy to help with both tasks.

## Task 1: HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 Comparison
### HTTP/2
- Introduced in 2015
- Binary protocol, multiplexing, and header compression
- Improved performance over HTTP/1.1
- Still uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

### HTTP/3
- Introduced in 2020
- Uses QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of TCP
- Key improvements:
    - Faster connection establishment: QUIC reduces handshake time.
    - Improved multiplexing: QUIC handles packet loss and reordering better.
